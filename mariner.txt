  It is an ancient Mariner,
  And he stoppeth one of three.
  "By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
  Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?
  The bridegroom's doors are opened wide,                              
  And I am next of kin;
  The guests are met, the feast is set:
  May'st hear the merry din."
  He holds him with his skinny hand,
  "There was a ship," quoth he.                                       
  "Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!"
  Eftsoons his hand dropt he.
  He holds him with his glittering eye--
  The Wedding-Guest stood still,
  And listens like a three years' child:                              
  The Mariner hath his will.
  The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:
  He cannot choose but hear;
  And thus spake on that ancient man,
  The bright-eyed Mariner.                                            
  "The ship was cheered, the harbor cleared,
  Merrily did we drop
  Below the kirk, below the hill,
  Below the lighthouse top.
  The sun came up upon the left,                                      
  Out of the sea came he!
  And he shone bright, and on the right
  Went down into the sea.
  Higher and higher every day,
  Till over the mast at noon--"                                       
  The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,
  For he heard the loud bassoon.
  The bride hath paced into the hall,
  Red as a rose is she;
  Nodding their heads before her goes                                 
  The merry minstrelsy.
  The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,
  Yet he cannot choose but hear;
  And thus spake on that ancient man,
  The bright-eyed Mariner.                                            
  "And now the Storm-blast came, and he
  Was tyrannous and strong:
  He struck with his o'ertaking wings,
  And chased us south along.
  With sloping masts and dipping prow,                                
  As who pursued with yell and blow
  Still treads the shadow of his foe,
  And forward bends his head,
  The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,
  And southward aye we fled.                                          
  And now there came both mist and snow,
  And it grew wondrous cold:
  And ice, mast-high, came floating by,
  As green as emerald.
  And through the drifts the snowy clifts                             
  Did send a dismal sheen:
  Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--
  The ice was all between.
  The ice was here, the ice was there,
  The ice was all around:                                             
  It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,
  Like noises in a swound!
  At length did cross an Albatross,
  Thorough the fog it came;
  As if it had been a Christian soul,                                 
  We hailed it in God's name.
  It ate the food it ne'er had eat,
  And round and round it flew.
  The ice did split with a thunder-fit;
  The helmsman steered us through!                                    
  And a good south wind sprung up behind;
  The Albatross did follow,
  And every day, for food or play,
  Came to the mariners' hollo!
  In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,                                
  It perched for vespers nine;
  Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,
  Glimmered the white moon-shine."
  "God save thee, ancient Mariner!
  From the fiends, that plague thee thus!--                           
  Why look'st thou so?"--"With my cross-bow
  I shot the Albatross.
  The Sun now rose upon the right:
  Out of the sea came he,
  Still hid in mist, and on the left                                  
  Went down into the sea.
  And the good south wind still blew behind,
  But no sweet bird did follow,
  Nor any day for food or play
  Came to the mariners' hollo!                                        
  And I had done a hellish thing,
  And it would work 'em woe:
  For all averred, I had killed the bird
  That made the breeze to blow.
  Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay,                             
  That made the breeze to blow!
  Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,
  The glorious Sun uprist:
  Then all averred, I had killed the bird
  That brought the fog and mist.                                     
  'T was right, said they, such birds to slay,
  That bring the fog and mist.
  The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,
  The furrow followed free;
  We were the first that ever burst                                  
  Into that silent sea.
  Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,
  'T was sad as sad could be;
  And we did speak only to break
  The silence of the sea!                                            
  All in a hot and copper sky,
  The bloody Sun, at noon,
  Right up above the mast did stand,
  No bigger than the Moon.
  Day after day, day after day,                                      
  We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
  As idle as a painted ship
  Upon a painted ocean.
  Water, water, every where,
  And all the boards did shrink;                                     
  Water, water, every where
  Nor any drop to drink.
  The very deep did rot: O Christ!
  That ever this should be!
  Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs                              
  Upon the slimy sea.
  About, about, in reel and rout
  The death-fires danced at night;
  The water, like a witch's oils,
  Burnt green, and blue and white.                                   
  And some in dreams assured were
  Of the Spirit that plagued us so;
  Nine fathom deep he had followed us
  From the land of mist and snow.
  And every tongue, through utter drought,                           
  Was withered at the root;
  We could not speak, no more than if
  We had been choked with soot.
  Ah! well-a-day! what evil looks
  Had I from old and young!                                          
  Instead of the cross, the Albatross
  About my neck was hung.
  There passed a weary time. Each throat
  Was parched, and glazed each eye.
  A weary time! a weary time!                                        
  How glazed each weary eye,
  When looking westward, I beheld
  A something in the sky.
  At first it seemed a little speck,
  And then it seemed a mist;                                         
  It moved and moved, and took at last
  A certain shape, I wist.
  A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!
  And still it neared and neared:
  As if it dodged a water-sprite,                                    
  It plunged and tacked and veered.
  With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
  We could nor laugh nor wail;
  Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
  I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,                                  
  And cried, A sail! a sail!
  Gramercy! they for joy did grin,
  And all at once their breath drew in,                              
  As they were drinking all.
  See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!
  Hither to work us weal;
  Without a breeze, without a tide,
  She steadies with upright keel!                                    
  The western wave was all a-flame.
  The day was well nigh done!
  Almost upon the western wave
  Rested the broad bright Sun;
  When that strange shape drove suddenly                             
  Betwixt us and the Sun;
  And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,
  (Heaven's Mother send us grace!)
  As if through a dungeon-grate he peered
  With broad and burning face.                                       
  Alas (thought I, and my heart beat loud)
  How fast she nears and nears!
  Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,
  Like restless gossameres?
  Are those her ribs through which the Sun                           
  Did peer, as through a grate?
  And is that Woman all her crew?
  Is that a Death? and are there two?
  Is Death that woman's mate?
  Her lips were red, her looks were free,                            
  Her locks were yellow as gold:
  Her skin was as white as leprosy,
  The Night-mare Life-in-Death was she,
  Who thicks man's blood with cold.
  The naked hulk alongside came,                                     
  And the twain were casting dice;
  'The game is done! I've won! I've won!'
  Quoth she, and whistles thrice.
  The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out;
  At one stride comes the dark;                                      
  With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,
  Off shot the spectre-bark.
  We listened and looked sideways up!
  Fear at my heart, as at a cup,
  My life-blood seemed to sip!                                       
  The stars were dim, and thick the night,
  The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;
  From the sails the dew did drip--
  Till clomb above the eastern bar
  The horned Moon, with one bright star                              
  Within the nether tip.
  One after one, by the star-dogged Moon,
  Too quick for groan or sigh,
  Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,
  And cursed me with his eye.                                        
  Four times fifty living men,
  (And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
  With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
  They dropped down one by one.
  The souls did from their bodies fly,--                             
  They fled to bliss or woe!
  And every soul, it passed me by,
  Like the whizz of my cross-bow!"
  "I Fear thee, ancient Mariner!
  I fear thy skinny hand!                                            
  And thou art long, and lank, and brown,
  As is the ribbed sea-sand.
  I fear thee and thy glittering eye,
  And thy skinny hand, so brown."--
  "Fear me not, fear not, thou wedding-guest!                        
  This body dropt not down.
  Alone, alone, all, all alone,
  Alone on the wide, wide sea!
  And never a saint took pity on
  My soul in agony.                                                  
  The many men, so beautiful!
  And they all dead did lie:
  And a thousand thousand slimy things
  Lived on; and so did I.
  I looked upon the rotting sea,                                     
  And drew my eyes away;
  I looked upon the rotting deck,
  And there the dead men lay.
  I looked to heaven, and tried to pray;
  But or ever a prayer had gusht,                                    
  A wicked whisper came, and made
  My heart as dry as dust.
  I closed my lids, and kept them close,
  And the balls like pulses beat;
  For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky                   
  Lay like a load on my weary eye,
  And the dead were at my feet.
  The cold sweat melted from their limbs,
  Nor rot nor reek did they:
  The look with which they looked on me
  Had never passed away.
  An orphan's curse would drag to hell
  A spirit from on high;
  But oh! more horrible than that
  Is a curse in a dead man's eye!
  Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,
  And yet I could not die.
  The moving Moon went up the sky,
  And nowhere did abide:
  Softly she was going up,
  And a star or two beside--
  Her beams bemocked the sultry main,
  Like April hoar-frost spread;
  But where the ship's huge shadow lay,
  The charmed water burnt alway
  A still and awful red.
  Beyond the shadow of the ship,
  I watched the water-snakes:
  They moved in tracks of shining white,
  And when they reared, the elfish light
  Fell off in hoary flakes.
  Within the shadow of the ship
  I watched their rich attire:
  Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,
  They coiled and swam; and every track                              
  Was a flash of golden fire.
  O happy living things! no tongue
  Their beauty might declare:
  A spring of love gushed from my heart,
  And I blessed them unaware:                                        
  Sure my kind saint took pity on me,
  And I blessed them unaware.
  The selfsame moment I could pray;
  And from my neck so free
  The Albatross fell off, and sank                                   
  Like lead into the sea.
  Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,
  Beloved from pole to pole!
  To Mary Queen the praise be given!
  She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,                             
  That slid into my soul.
  The silly buckets on the deck,
  That had so long remained,
  I dreamt that they were filled with dew;
  And when I awoke, it rained.                                       
  My lips were wet, my throat was cold,
  My garments all were dank;
  Sure I had drunken in my dreams,
  And still my body drank.
  I moved, and could not feel my limbs:                              
  I was so light--almost
  I thought that I had died in sleep,
  And was a blessed ghost.
  And soon I heard a roaring wind:
  It did not come anear;                                             
  But with its sound it shook the sails,
  That were so thin and sere.
  The upper air burst into life!
  And a hundred fire-flags sheen,
  To and fro they were hurried about!                                
  And to and fro, and in and out,
  The wan stars danced between.
  And the coming wind did roar more loud,
  And the sails did sigh like sedge;
  And the rain poured down from one black cloud;                     
  The Moon was at its edge.
  The thick black cloud was cleft, and still
  The Moon was at its side.
  Like waters shot from some high crag,
  The lightning fell with never a jag,                               
  A river steep and wide.
  The loud wind never reached the ship,
  Yet now the ship moved on!
  Beneath the lightning and the Moon
  The dead men gave a groan.                                         
  They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,
  Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;
  It had been strange, even in a dream,
  To have seen those dead men rise.
  The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;                           
  Yet never a breeze up blew;
  The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,
  Where they were wont to do;
  They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--
  We were a ghastly crew.                                            
  The body of my brother's son
  Stood by me, knee to knee:
  The body and I pulled at one rope,
  But he said nought to me."
  "I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"                                    
  "Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!
  'T was not those souls that fled in pain,
  Which to their corses came again,
  But a troop of spirits blest:
  For when it dawned--they dropped their arms,
  And clustered round the mast;                                      
  Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,
  And from their bodies passed.
  Around, around, flew each sweet sound,
  Then darted to the Sun;                                            
  Slowly the sounds came back again,
  Now mixed, now one by one.
  Sometimes a-dropping from the sky
  I heard the sky-lark sing;
  Sometimes all little birds that are,                               
  How they seemed to fill the sea and air
  With their sweet jargoning!
  And now 't was like all instruments,
  Now like a lonely flute;
  And now it is an angel's song,                                     
  That makes the heavens be mute.
  It ceased; yet still the sails made on
  A pleasant noise till noon,
  A noise like of a hidden brook
  In the leafy month of June,                                        
  That to the sleeping woods all night
  Singeth a quiet tune.
  Till noon we quietly sailed on,
  Yet never a breeze did breathe:
  Slowly and smoothly went the ship,                                 
  Moved onward from beneath.
  Under' the keel nine fathom deep,
  From the land of mist and snow,
  The spirit slid: and it was he
  That made the ship to go.                                          
  The sails at noon left off their tune,
  And the ship stood still also.
  The Sun, right up above the mast,
  Had fixed her to the ocean:
  But in a minute she 'gan stir,                                     
  With a short uneasy motion--
  Backwards and forwards half her length
  With a short uneasy motion.
  Then like a pawing horse let go,
  She made a sudden bound:                                           
  It flung the blood into my head,
  And I fell down in a swound.
  How long in that same fit I lay,
  I have not to declare;
  But ere my living life returned,                                   
  I heard and in my soul discerned
  Two voices in the air.
  'Is it he?' quoth one, 'Is this the man?
  By him who died on cross,
  With his cruel bow he laid full low                                
  The harmless Albatross.
  The spirit who bideth by himself
  In the land of mist and snow,
  He loved the bird that loved the man
  Who shot him with his bow?'                                        
  The other was a softer voice,
  As soft as honey-dew:
  Quoth he, 'The man hath penance done,
  And penance more will do.'
  'But tell me, tell me! speak again, 
  Thy soft response renewing--
  What makes that ship drive on so fast?
  What is the ocean doing?'
  'Still as a slave before his lord,
  The ocean hath no blast; 
  His great bright eye most silently
  Up to the Moon is cast--
  If he may know which way to go;
  For she guides him smooth or grim.
  See, brother, see! how graciously 
  She looketh down on him.'
  'But why drives on that ship so fast?
  Without or wave or wind?'
  'The air is cut away before,
  And closes from behind. 
  Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high!
  Or we shall be belated:
  For slow and slow that ship will go,
  When the Mariner's trance is abated.
  I woke, and we were sailing on                                     
  As in a gentle weather:
  'T was night, calm night, the moon was high,
  The dead men stood together.
  All stood together on the deck,
  For a charnel-dungeon fitter:                                      
  All fixed on me their stony eyes,
  That in the Moon did glitter.
  The pang, the curse, with which they died,
  Had never passed away:
  I could not draw my eyes from theirs,                              
  Nor turn them up to pray.
  And now this spell was snapt: once more
  I viewed the ocean green,
  And looked far forth, yet little saw
  Of what had else been seen--                                       
  Like one, that on a lonesome road
  Doth walk in fear and dread,
  And having once turned round walks on,
  And turns no more his head;
  Because he knows, a frightful fiend                                
  Doth close behind him tread.
  But soon there breathed a wind on me,
  Nor sound nor motion made:
  Its path was not upon the sea,
  In ripple or in shade.                                             
  It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek
  Like a meadow-gale of spring--
  It mingled strangely with my fears,
  Yet it felt like a welcoming.
  Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,                                    
  Yet she sailed softly too:
  Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--
  On me alone it blew.
  Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed
  The light-house top I see?                                         
  Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
  Is this mine own countree?
  We drifted o'er the harbor-bar,
  And I with sobs did pray--
  O let me be awake, my God!                                         
  Or let me sleep alway.
  The harbor-bay was clear as glass,
  So smoothly it was strewn!
  And on the bay the moonlight lay,
  And the shadow of the Moon.                                        
  The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,
  That stands above the rock:
  The moonlight steeped in silentness
  The steady weathercock.
  And the bay was white with silent light                            
  Till rising from the same,
  Full many shapes, that shadows were,
  In crimson colors came.
  A little distance from the prow
  Those crimson shadows were:                                        
  I turned my eyes upon the deck--
  Oh, Christ! what saw I there!
  Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,
  And, by the holy rood!
  A man all light, a seraph-man,                                     
  On every corse there stood.
  This seraph-band, each waved his hand:
  It was a heavenly sight!
  They stood as signals to the land,
  Each one a lovely light;                                           
  This seraph-band, each waved his hand,
  No voice did they impart--
  No voice; but oh! the silence sank
  Like music on my heart.
  But soon I heard the dash of oars,                                 
  I heard the Pilot's cheer;
  My head was turned perforce away,
  And I saw a boat appear.
  The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,
  I heard them coming fast:                                          
  Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
  The dead men could not blast.
  I saw a third--I heard his voice:
  It is the Hermit good!
  He singeth loud his godly hymns                                    
  That he makes in the wood.
  He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away
  The Albatross's blood.
  This Hermit good lives in that wood
  Which slopes down to the sea.                                      
  How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
  He loves to talk with marineres
  That come from a far countree.
  He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve--
  He hath a cushion plump:                                           
  It is the moss that wholly hides
  The rotted old oak-stump.
  The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,
  'Why, this is strange, I trow!
  Where are those lights, so many and fair,                          
  That signal made but now?'
  'Strange, by my faith!' the Hermit said--
  'And they answered not our cheer!
  The planks looked warped! and see those sails,
  How thin they are and sere!                                        
  I never saw aught like to them,
  Unless perchance it were
  Brown skeletons of leaves that lag
  My forest-brook along;
  When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,                               
  And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,
  That eats the she-wolf's young.'
  'Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look--
  (The Pilot made reply)
  I am a-feared'--'Push on, push on!'                                
  Said the Hermit cheerily.
  The boat came closer to the ship,
  But I nor spake nor stirred;
  The boat came close beneath the ship,
  And straight a sound was heard.                                    
  Under the water it rumbled on,
  Still louder and more dread:
  It reached the ship, it split the bay;
  The ship went down like lead.
  Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,                           
  Which sky and ocean smote,
  Like one that hath been seven days drowned
  My body lay afloat;
  But swift as dreams, myself I found
  Within the Pilot's boat.                                           
  Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,
  The boat spun round and round;
  And all was still, save that the hill
  Was telling of the sound.
  I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked                                
  And fell down in a fit;
  The holy Hermit raised his eyes,
  And prayed where he did sit.
  I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,
  Who now doth crazy go,                                             
  Laughed loud and long, and all the while
  His eyes went to and fro.
  'Ha! ha!' quoth he, 'full plain I see,
  The Devil knows how to row.'
  And now, all in my own countree,                                   
  I stood on the firm land!
  The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,
  And scarcely he could stand.
  'O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!'
  The Hermit crossed his brow.                                       
  'Say quick,' quoth he, 'I bid thee say--
  What manner of man art thou?'
  Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched
  With a woful agony,
  Which forced me to begin my tale;                                  
  And then it left me free.
  Since then, at an uncertain hour,
  That agony returns:
  And till my ghastly tale is told,
  This heart within me burns.                                        
  I pass, like night, from land to land;
  I have strange power of speech;
  That moment that his face I see,
  I know the man that must hear me:
  To him my tale I teach.                                            
  What loud uproar bursts from that door!
  The wedding-guests are there:
  But in the garden-bower the bride
  And bride-maids singing are:
  And hark the little vesper bell,                                   
  Which biddeth me to prayer!
  O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been
  Alone on a wide, wide sea:
  So lonely 't was, that God himself
  Scarce seemed there to be.                                         
  O sweeter than the marriage-feast,
  'T is sweeter far to me,
  To walk together to the kirk
  With a goodly company!--
  To walk together to the kirk,                                      
  And all together pray,
  While each to his great Father bends,
  Old men, and babes, and loving friends
  And youths and maidens gay!
  Farewell, farewell! but this I tell                                
  To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!
  He prayeth well, who loveth well
  Both man and bird and beast.
  He prayeth best, who loveth best
  All things both great and small;                                   
  For the dear God who loveth us,
  He made and loveth all."
  The Mariner, whose eye is bright,
  Whose beard with age is hoar,
  Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest                                 
  Turned from the bridegroom's door.
  He went like one that hath been stunned,
  And is of sense forlorn:
  A sadder and a wiser man,
  He rose the morrow morn.                                           
  'Tis the middle of night by the castle clock,
  And the owls have awakened the crowing cock.
  Tu--whit!----Tu--whoo!
  And hark, again! the crowing cock,
  How drowsily it crew.                                                
  Sir Leoline, the Baron rich,
  Hath a toothless mastiff, which
  From her kennel beneath the rock
  Maketh answer to the clock,
  Four for the quarters, and twelve for the hour;                     
  Ever and aye, by shine and shower,
  Sixteen short howls, not over loud;
  Some say, she sees my lady's shroud.
  Is the night chilly and dark?
  The night is chilly, but not dark.                                  
  The thin gray cloud is spread on high,
  It covers but not hides the sky.
  The moon is behind, and at the full;
  And yet she looks both small and dull.
  The night is chill, the cloud is gray:                              
  'T is a month before the month of May,
  And the Spring comes slowly up this way.
  The lovely lady, Christabel,
  Whom her father loves so well,
  What makes her in the wood so late,                                 
  A furlong from the castle gate?
  She had dreams all yesternight
  Of her own betrothed knight;
  And she in the midnight wood will pray
  For the weal of her lover that's far away.                          
  She stole along, she nothing spoke,
  The sighs she heaved were soft and low,
  And naught was green upon the oak
  But moss and rarest mistletoe:
  She kneels beneath the huge oak tree,                               
  And in silence prayeth she.
  The lady sprang up suddenly,
  The lovely lady, Christabel!
  It moaned as near, as near can be,
  But what it is she cannot tell.--                                   
  On the other side it seems to be,
  Of the huge, broad-breasted, old oak tree.
  The night is chill; the forest bare;
  Is it the wind that moaneth bleak?
  There is not wind enough in the air                                 
  To move away the ringlet curl
  From the lovely lady's cheek--
  There is not wind enough to twirl
  The one red leaf, the last of its clan,
  That dances as often as dance it can,                               
  Hanging so light, and hanging so high,
  On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky.
  Hush, beating heart of Christabel!
  Jesu, Maria, shield her well!
  She folded her arms beneath her cloak,                              
  And stole to the other side of the oak.
    What sees she there?
  There she sees a damsel bright,
  Drest in a silken robe of white,
  That shadowy in the moonlight shone:                                
  The neck that made that white robe wan,
  Her stately neck, and arms were bare;
  Her blue-veined feet unsandal'd were,
  And wildly glittered here and there
  The gems entangled in her hair.                                     
  I guess, 'twas frightful there to see
  A lady so richly clad as she--
  Beautiful exceedingly!
  "Mary mother, save me now!"
  Said Christabel, "And who art thou?"                                
  The lady strange made answer meet,
  And her voice was faint and sweet:--
  "Have pity on my sore distress,
  I scarce can speak for weariness:
  Stretch forth thy hand, and have no fear!"                          
  Said Christabel, "How camest thou here?"
  And the lady, whose voice was faint and sweet,
  Did thus pursue her answer meet:--
  "My sire is of a noble line,
  And my name is Geraldine:                                           
  Five warriors seized me yestermorn,
  Me, even me, a maid forlorn:
  They choked my cries with force and fright,
  And tied me on a palfrey white.
  The palfrey was as fleet as wind,                                   
  And they rode furiously behind.
  They spurred amain, their steeds were white:
  And once we crossed the shade of night.
  As sure as Heaven shall rescue me,
  I have no thought what men they be;                                 
  Nor do I know how long it is
  (For I have lain entranced I wis)
  Since one, the tallest of the five,
  Took me from the palfrey's back,
  A weary woman, scarce alive.                                        
  Some muttered words his comrades spoke:
  He placed me underneath this oak;
  He swore they would return with haste;
  Whither they went I cannot tell--
  I thought I heard, some minutes past,                              
  Sounds as of a castle bell.
  Stretch forth thy hand," thus ended she,
  "And help a wretched maid to flee."
  Then Christabel stretched forth her hand,
  And comforted fair Geraldine:                                      
  "O well, bright dame! may you command
  The service of Sir Leoline;
  And gladly our stout chivalry
  Will he send forth and friends withal
  To guide and guard you safe and free                               
  Home to your noble father's hall."
  She rose: and forth with steps they passed
  That strove to be, and were not, fast.
  Her gracious stars the lady blest,
  And thus spake on sweet Christabel:                                
  "All our household are at rest,
  The hall as silent as the cell;
  Sir Leoline is weak in health,
  And may not well awakened be,
  But we will move as if in stealth,                                 
  And I beseech your courtesy,
  This night, to share your couch with me."
  They crossed the moat, and Christabel
  Took the key that fitted well;
  A little door she opened straight,                                 
  All in the middle of the gate;
  The gate that was ironed within and without,
  Where an army in battle array had marched out.
  The lady sank, belike through pain,
  And Christabel with might and main                                 
  Lifted her up, a weary weight,
  Over the threshold of the gate:
  Then the lady rose again,
  And moved, as she were not in pain.
  So free from danger, free from fear,                               
  They crossed the court: right glad they were.
  And Christabel devoutly cried
  To the lady by her side,
  "Praise we the Virgin all divine
  Who hath rescued thee from thy distress!"                          
  "Alas, alas!" said Geraldine,
  "I cannot speak for weariness."
  So free from danger, free from fear,
  They crossed the court: right glad they were.
  Outside her kennel, the mastiff old                                
  Lay fast asleep, in moonshine cold.
  The mastiff old did not awake,
  Yet she an angry moan did make!
  And what can ail the mastiff bitch?
  Never till now she uttered yell                                    
  Beneath the eye of Christabel.
  Perhaps it is the owlet's scritch:
  For what can ail the mastiff bitch?
  They passed the hall, that echoes still,
  Pass as lightly as you will!                                       
  The brands were flat, the brands were dying,
  Amid their own white ashes lying;
  But when the lady passed, there came
  A tongue of light, a fit of flame;
  And Christabel saw the lady's eye,                                 
  And nothing else saw she thereby,
  Save the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall,
  Which hung in a murky old niche in the wall.
  "O softly tread," said Christabel,
  "My father seldom sleepeth well."                                  
  Sweet Christabel her feet doth bare,
  And jealous of the listening air
  They steal their way from stair to stair,
  Now in glimmer, and now in gloom,
  And now they pass the Baron's room,                                
  As still as death, with stifled breath
  And now have reached her chamber door;
  And now doth Geraldine press down
  The rushes of the chamber floor.
  The moon shines dim in the open air,                               
  And not a moonbeam enters here.
  But they without its light can see
  The chamber carved so curiously,
  Carved with figures strange and sweet,
  All made out of the carver's brain,                                
  For a lady's chamber meet:
  The lamp with twofold silver chain
  Is fastened to an angel's feet.
  The silver lamp burns dead and dim;
  But Christabel the lamp will trim.                                 
  She trimmed the lamp, and made it bright,
  And left it swinging to and fro,
  While Geraldine, in wretched plight,
  Sank down upon the floor below.
  "O weary lady, Geraldine,                                          
  I pray you, drink this cordial wine!
  It is a wine of virtuous powers;
  My mother made it of wild flowers."
  "And will your mother pity me,
  Who am a maiden most forlorn?                                      
  Christabel answered--"Woe is me!
  She died the hour that I was born.
  I have heard the gray-haired friar tell
  How on her death-bed she did say,
  That she should hear the castle-bell                               
  Strike twelve upon my wedding-day.
  O mother dear! that thou wert here!"
  "I would," said Geraldine, "she were!"
  But soon with altered voice, said she--
  "Off, wandering mother! Peak and pine!                             
  I have power to bid thee flee."
  Alas! what ails poor Geraldine?
  Why stares she with unsettled eye?
  Can she the bodiless dead espy?
  And why with hollow voice cries she,                               
  "Off, woman, off! this hour is mine--
  Though thou her guardian spirit be,
  Off, woman, off! 'tis given to me."
  Then Christabel knelt by the lady's side,
  And raised to heaven her eyes so blue--                            
  "Alas!" said she, "this ghastly ride--
  Dear lady! it hath wildered you!"
  The lady wiped her moist cold brow,
  And faintly said, "'Tis over now!"
  Again the wild-flower wine she drank:                              
  Her fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright,
  And from the floor whereon she sank,
  The lofty lady stood upright:
  She was most beautiful to see,
  Like a lady of a far countree.                                     
  And thus the lofty lady spake--
  "All they who live in the upper sky,
  Do love you, holy Christabel!
  And you love them, and for their sake
  And for the good which me befell,                                  
  Even I in my degree will try,
  Fair maiden, to requite you well.
  But now unrobe yourself; for I
  Must pray, ere yet in bed I lie."
  Quoth Christabel, "So let it be!"                                  
  And as the lady bade, did she.
  Her gentle limbs did she undress,
  And lay down in her loveliness.
  But through her brain of weal and woe
  So many thoughts moved to and fro,                                 
  That vain it were her lids to close;
  So half-way from the bed she rose,
  And on her elbow did recline
  To look at the Lady Geraldine.
  Beneath the lamp the lady bowed,                                   
  And slowly rolled her eyes around;
  Then drawing in her breath aloud,
  Like one that shuddered, she unbound
  The cincture from beneath her breast:
  Her silken robe, and inner vest,                                   
  Dropt to her feet, and full in view,
  Behold! her bosom and half her side--
  A sight to dream of, not to tell!
  O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!
  Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs;                                
  Ah! what a stricken look was hers!
  Deep from within she seems half-way
  To lift some weight with sick assay,
  And eyes the maid and seeks delay;
  Then suddenly, as one defied,                                      
  Collects herself in scorn and pride,
  And lay down by the Maiden's side!--
  And in her arms the maid she took,
          Ah wel-a-day!
  And with low voice and doleful look                                
  These words did say:
  "In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell,
  Which is lord of thy utterance, Christabel!
  Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow,
  This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow;                     
    But vainly thou warrest,
      For this is alone in
    Thy power to declare,
      That in the dim forest
    Thou heard'st a low moaning,                                     
  And found'st a bright lady, surpassingly fair;
  And didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity,
  To shield her and shelter her from the damp air."
  It was a lovely sight to see
  The lady Christabel, when she                                      
  Was praying at the old oak tree.
    Amid the jagged shadows
    Of mossy leafless boughs,
    Kneeling in the moonlight,
    To make her gentle vows;                                         
  Her slender palms together prest,
  Heaving sometimes on her breast;
  Her face resigned to bliss or bale--
  Her face, oh call it fair not pale,
  And both blue eyes more bright than clear,                         
  Each about to have a tear.
  With open eyes (ah woe is me!)
  Asleep, and dreaming fearfully,
  Fearfully dreaming, yet, I wis,
  Dreaming that alone, which is--                                    
  O sorrow and shame! Can this be she,
  The lady, who knelt at the old oak tree?
  And lo! the worker of these harms,
  That holds the maiden in her arms,
  Seems to slumber still and mild,                                   
  As a mother with her child.
  A star hath set, a star hath risen,
  O Geraldine! since arms of thine
  Have been the lovely lady's prison.
  O Geraldine! one hour was thine--                                  
  Thou 'st had thy will! By tairn and rill,
  The night-birds all that hour were still.
  But now they are jubilant anew,
  From cliff and tower, tu--whoo! tu--whoo!
  Tu--whoo! tu--whoo! from wood and fell!                            
  And see! the lady Christabel
  Gathers herself from out her trance;
  Her limbs relax, her countenance
  Grows sad and soft; the smooth thin lids
  Close o'er her eyes; and tears she sheds--                         
  Large tears that leave the lashes bright!
  And oft the while she seems to smile
  As infants at a sudden light!
  Yea, she doth smile, and she doth weep,
  Like a youthful hermitess,                                         
  Beauteous in a wilderness,
  Who, praying always, prays in sleep.
  And, if she move unquietly,
  Perchance, 'tis but the blood so free
  Comes back and tingles in her feet.                                
  No doubt, she hath a vision sweet.
  What if her guardian spirit 'twere,
  What if she knew her mother near?
  But this she knows, in joys and woes,
  That saints will aid if men will call:                             
  For the blue sky bends over all!
  "Each matin bell," the Baron saith,
  "Knells us back to a world of death."
  These words Sir Leoline first said,
  When he rose and found his lady dead:                              
  These words Sir Leoline will say
  Many a morn to his dying day!
  And hence the custom and law began
  That still at dawn the sacristan,
  Who duly pulls the heavy bell,                                     
  Five and forty beads must tell
  Between each stroke--a warning knell,
  Which not a soul can choose but hear
  From Bratha Head to Wyndermere.
  Saith Bracy the bard, "So let it knell!                            
  And let the drowsy sacristan
  Still count as slowly as he can!
  There is no lack of such, I ween,
  As well fill up the space between.
  In Langdale Pike and Witch's Lair,                                 
  And Dungeon-ghyll so foully rent,
  With ropes of rock and bells of air
  Three sinful sextons' ghosts are pent,
  Who all give back, one after t' other,
  The death-note to their living brother;                            
  And oft too, by the knell offended,
  Just as their one! two! three! is ended,
  The devil mocks the doleful tale
  With a merry peal from Borrowdale."
  The air is still! through mist and cloud                           
  That merry peal comes ringing loud;
  And Geraldine shakes off her dread,
  And rises lightly from the bed;
  Puts on her silken vestments white,
  And tricks her hair in lovely plight,                              
  And nothing doubting of her spell
  Awakens the lady Christabel.
  "Sleep you, sweet lady Christabel?
  I trust that you have rested well."
  And Christabel awoke and spied                                     
  The same who lay down by her side--
  O rather say, the same whom she
  Raised up beneath the old oak tree!
  Nay, fairer yet! and yet more fair!
  For she belike hath drunken deep                                   
  Of all the blessedness of sleep!
  And while she spake, her looks, her air,
  Such gentle thankfulness declare,
  That (so it seemed) her girded vests
  Grew tight beneath her heaving breasts.                            
  "Sure I have sinn'd!" said Christabel,
  "Now heaven be praised if all be well!"
  And in low faltering tones, yet sweet,
  Did she the lofty lady greet
  With such perplexity of mind                                       
  As dreams too lively leave behind.
  So quickly she rose, and quickly arrayed
  Her maiden limbs, and having prayed
  That He, who on the cross did groan,
  Might wash away her sins unknown,                                  
  She forthwith led fair Geraldine
  To meet her sire, Sir Leoline.
  The lovely maid and the lady tall
  Are pacing both into the hall,
  And pacing on through page and groom,                              
  Enter the Baron's presence-room.
  The Baron rose, and while he prest
  His gentle daughter to his breast,
  With cheerful wonder in his eyes
  The lady Geraldine espies,                                         
  And gave such welcome to the same,
  As might beseem so bright a dame!
  But when he heard the lady's tale,
  And when she told her father's name,
  Why waxed Sir Leoline so pale,                                     
  Murmuring o'er the name again,
  Lord Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine?
  Alas! they had been friends in youth;
  But whispering tongues can poison truth;
  And constancy lives in realms above;                               
  And life is thorny; and youth is vain;
  And to be wroth with one we love
  Doth work like madness in the brain.
  And thus it chanced, as I divine,
  With Roland and Sir Leoline.                                       
  Each spake words of high disdain
  And insult to his heart's best brother:
  They parted--ne'er to meet again!
  But never either found another
  To free the hollow heart from paining--                            
  They stood aloof, the scars remaining,
  Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;
  A dreary sea now flows between.
  But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,
  Shall wholly do away, I ween,                                      
  The marks of that which once hath been.
  Sir Leoline, a moment's space,
  Stood gazing on the damsel's face:
  And the youthful Lord of Tryermaine
  Came back upon his heart again.                                    
  O then the Baron forgot his age,
  His noble heart swelled high with rage;
  He swore by the wounds in Jesu's side
  He would proclaim it far and wide,
  With trump and solemn heraldry,                                    
  That they, who thus had wronged the dame
  Were base as spotted infamy!
  "And if they dare deny the same,
  My herald shall appoint a week,
  And let the recreant traitors seek                                 
  My tourney court--that there and then
  I may dislodge their reptile souls
  From the bodies and forms of men!"
  He spake: his eye in lightning rolls!
  For the lady was ruthlessly seized; and he kenned                  
  In the beautiful lady the child of his friend!
  And now the tears were on his face,
  And fondly in his arms he took
  Fair Geraldine, who met the embrace,
  Prolonging it with joyous look.                                    
  Which when she viewed, a vision fell
  Upon the soul of Christabel,
  The vision of fear, the touch and pain!
  She shrunk and shuddered, and saw again--
  (Ah, woe is me! Was it for thee,                                   
  Thou gentle maid! such sights to see?)
  Again she saw that bosom old,
  Again she felt that bosom cold,
  And drew in her breath with a hissing sound:
  Whereat the Knight turned wildly round,                            
  And nothing saw, but his own sweet maid
  With eyes upraised, as one that prayed.
  The touch, the sight, had passed away,
  And in its stead that vision blest,
  Which comforted her after-rest,                                    
  While in the lady's arms she lay,
  Had put a rapture in her breast,
  And on her lips and o'er her eyes
  Spread smiles like light!
                            With new surprise,
  "What ails then my beloved child?"                                 
  The Baron said--His daughter mild
  Made answer, "All will yet be well!"
  I ween, she had no power to tell
  Aught else: so mighty was the spell.
  Yet he, who saw this Geraldine,                                    
  Had deemed her sure a thing divine.
  Such sorrow with such grace she blended,
  As if she feared she had offended
  Sweet Christabel, that gentle maid!
  And with such lowly tones she prayed                               
  She might be sent without delay
  Home to her father's mansion.
                                "Nay!
  Nay, by my soul!" said Leoline.
  "Ho! Bracy the bard, the charge be thine!
  Go thou, with music sweet and loud,                                
  And take two steeds with trappings proud,
  And take the youth whom thou lov'st best
  To bear thy harp, and learn thy song,
  And clothe you both in solemn vest,
  And over the mountains haste along,                                
  Lest wandering folk, that are abroad,
  Detain you on the valley road.
  "And when he has crossed the Irthing flood,
  My merry bard! he hastes, he hastes
  Up Knorren Moor, through Halegarth Wood,                           
  And reaches soon that castle good
  Which stands and threatens Scotland's wastes.
  "Bard Bracy! bard Bracy! your horses are fleet,
  Ye must ride up the hall, your music so sweet,
  More loud than your horses' echoing feet!                          
  And loud and loud to Lord Roland call,
  'Thy daughter is safe in Langdale hall!
  Thy beautiful daughter is safe and free--
  Sir Leoline greets thee thus through me.
  He bids thee come without delay                                    
  With all thy numerous array
  And take thy lovely daughter home:
  And he will meet thee on the way
  With all his numerous array
  White with their panting palfreys' foam':                          
  And, by mine honour! I will say,
  That I repent me of the day
  When I spake words of fierce disdain
  To Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine!--
  --For since that evil hour hath flown,                             
  Many a summer's sun hath shone;
  Yet ne'er found I a friend again
  Like Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine."
  The lady fell, and clasped his knees,
  Her face upraised, her eyes o'erflowing;                           
  And Bracy replied, with faltering voice,
  His gracious hail on all bestowing;
  "Thy words, thou sire of Christabel,
  Are sweeter than my harp can tell;
  Yet might I gain a boon of thee,                                   
  This day my journey should not be,
  So strange a dream hath come to me;
  That I had vowed with music loud
  To clear yon wood from thing unblest,
  Warned by a vision in my rest!                                     
  For in my sleep I saw that dove,
  That gentle bird, whom thou dost love,
  And call'st by thy own daughter's name--
  Sir Leoline! I saw the same,
  Fluttering, and uttering fearful moan,                             
  Among the green herbs in the forest alone.
  Which when I saw and when I heard,
  I wondered what might ail the bird;
  For nothing near it could I see,
  Save the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree.            
  "And in my dream, methought, I went
  To search out what might there be found;
  And what the sweet bird's trouble meant,
  That thus lay fluttering on the ground.
  I went and peered, and could descry                                
  No cause for her distressful cry;
  But yet for her dear lady's sake
  I stooped, methought, the dove to take,
  When lo! I saw a bright green snake
  Coiled around its wings and neck.                                  
  Green as the herbs on which it couched,
  Close by the dove's its head it crouched;
  And with the dove it heaves and stirs,
  Swelling its neck as she swelled hers!
  I woke; it was the midnight hour,                                  
  The clock was echoing in the tower;
  But though my slumber was gone by,
  This dream it would not pass away--
  It seems to live upon my eye!
  And thence I vowed this self-same day                              
  With music strong and saintly song
  To wander through the forest bare,
  Lest aught unholy loiter there."
  Thus Bracy said: the Baron, the while,
  Half-listening heard him with a smile;                             
  Then turned to Lady Geraldine,
  His eyes made up of wonder and love;
  And said in courtly accents fine,
  "Sweet maid, Lord Roland's beauteous dove,
  With arms more strong than harp or song,                           
  Thy sire and I will crush the snake!"
  He kissed her forehead as he spake,
  And Geraldine in maiden wise
  Casting down her large bright eyes,
  With blushing cheek and courtesy fine                              
  She turned her from Sir Leoline;
  Softly gathering up her train,
  That o'er her right arm fell again;
  And folded her arms across her chest,
  And couched her head upon her breast,                              
  And looked askance at Christabel--
  Jesu, Maria, shield her well!
  A snake's small eye blinks dull and shy,
  And the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head,
  Each shrunk up to a serpent's eye,                                 
  And with somewhat of malice, and more of dread,
  At Christabel she looked askance!--
  One moment--and the sight was fled!
  But Christabel in dizzy trance
  Stumbling on the unsteady ground                                   
  Shuddered aloud, with a hissing sound;
  And Geraldine again turned round,
  And like a thing, that sought relief,
  Full of wonder and full of grief,
  She rolled her large bright eyes divine                            
  Wildly on Sir Leoline.
  The maid, alas! her thoughts are gone,
  She nothing sees--no sight but one!
  The maid, devoid of guile and sin,
  I know not how, in fearful wise,                                   
  So deeply had she drunken in
  That look, those shrunken serpent eyes,
  That all her features were resigned
  To this sole image in her mind:
  And passively did imitate                                          
  That look of dull and treacherous hate!
  And thus she stood, in dizzy trance,
  Still picturing that look askance
  With forced unconscious sympathy
  Full before her father's view--                                    
  As far as such a look could be
  In eyes so innocent and blue!
  And when the trance was o'er, the maid
  Paused awhile, and inly prayed:
  Then falling at the Baron's feet,                                  
  "By my mother's soul, do I entreat
  That thou this woman send away!"
  She said: and more she could not say:
  For what she knew she could not tell,
  O'er-mastered by the mighty spell.                                 
  Why is thy cheek so wan and wild,
  Sir Leoline? Thy only child
  Lies at thy feet, thy joy, thy pride,
  So fair, so innocent, so mild;
  The same, for whom thy lady died!                                  
  O, by the pangs of her dear mother
  Think thou no evil of thy child!
  For her, and thee, and for no other,
  She prayed the moment ere she died:
  Prayed that the babe for whom she died,                            
  Might prove her dear lord's joy and pride!
    That prayer her deadly pangs beguiled,
      Sir Leoline!
  And wouldst thou wrong thy only child,
      Her child and thine?                                           
  Within the Baron's heart and brain
  If thoughts, like these, had any share,
  They only swelled his rage and pain,
  And did but work confusion there.
  His heart was cleft with pain and rage,                            
  His cheeks they quivered, his eyes were wild,
  Dishonoured thus in his old age;
  Dishonour'd by his only child,
  And all his hospitality
  To the insulted daughter of his friend                             
  By more than woman's jealousy
  Brought thus to a disgraceful end--
  He rolled his eye with stern regard
  Upon the gentle minstrel bard,
  And said in tones abrupt, austere--                                
  "Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter here?
  I bade thee hence!" The bard obeyed;
  And turning from his own sweet maid,
  The aged knight, Sir Leoline,
  Led forth the lady Geraldine!                                      
  A little child, a limber elf,
  Singing, dancing to itself,
  A fairy thing with red round cheeks,
  That always finds, and never seeks,
  Makes such a vision to the sight                                   
  As fills a father's eyes with light;
  And pleasures flow in so thick and fast
  Upon his heart, that he at last
  Must needs express his love's excess
  With words of unmeant bitterness.                                  
  Perhaps 'tis pretty to force together
  Thoughts so all unlike each other;
  To mutter and mock a broken charm,
  To dally with wrong that does no harm.
  Perhaps 'tis tender too and pretty                                 
  At each wild word to feel within
  A sweet recoil of love and pity.
  And what, if in a world of sin
  (O sorrow and shame should this be true!)
  Such giddiness of heart and brain                                  
  Comes seldom save from rage and pain,
  So talks as it's most used to do.
  In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
  A stately pleasure-dome decree:
  Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
  Through caverns measureless to man
    Down to a sunless sea.                                             
  So twice five miles of fertile ground
  With walls and towers were girdled round:
  And here were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
  Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
  And here were forests ancient as the hills,                         
  Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
  But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
  Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
  A savage place! as holy and enchanted
  As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted                           
  By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
  And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
  As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
  A mighty fountain momently was forced:
  Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst                             
  Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
  Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:
  And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
  It flung up momently the sacred river.
  Five miles meandering with a mazy motion                            
  Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
  Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
  And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
  And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
  Ancestral voices prophesying war!                                   
      The shadow of the dome of pleasure
      Floated midway on the waves;
    Where was heard the mingled measure
      From the fountain and the caves.
  It was a miracle of rare device,                                    
  A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!
      A damsel with a dulcimer
      In a vision once I saw:
      It was an Abyssinian maid,
      And on her dulcimer she played,                                 
      Singing of Mount Abora.
      Could I revive within me.
      Her symphony and song,
      To such a deep delight 'twould win me,
  That with music loud and long,                                      
  I would build that dome in air,
  That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
  And all who heard should see them there,
  And all should cry, Beware! Beware!
  His flashing eyes, his floating hair!                               
  Weave a circle round him thrice,
  And close your eyes with holy dread,
  For he on honey-dew hath fed,
  And drunk the milk of Paradise.
  All thoughts, all passions, all delights,
  Whatever stirs this mortal frame,
  All are but ministers of Love,
    And feed his sacred flame.
  Oft in my waking dreams do I                                         
  Live o'er again that happy hour,
  When midway on the mount I lay,
    Beside the ruined tower.
  The moonshine, stealing o'er the scene,
  Had blended with the lights of eve;                                 
  And she was there, my hope, my joy,
    My own dear Genevieve!
  She leant against the armed man,
  The statue of the armed knight;
  She stood and listened to my lay,                                   
    Amid the lingering light.
  Few sorrows hath she of her own.
  My hope! my joy! my Genevieve!
  She loves me best, whene'er I sing
    The songs that make her grieve.                                   
  I played a soft and doleful air,
  I sang an old and moving story--
  An old rude song, that suited well
    That ruin wild and hoary.
  She listened with a flitting blush,                                 
  With downcast eyes and modest grace;
  For well she knew, I could not choose
    But gaze upon her face.
  I told her of the Knight that wore
  Upon his shield a burning brand;                                    
  And that for ten long years he wooed
    The Lady of the Land.
  I told her how he pined: and ah!
  The deep, the low, the pleading tone
  With which I sang another's love,                                   
    Interpreted my own.
  She listened with a flitting blush,
  With downcast eyes, and modest grace
  And she forgave me, that I gazed
    Too fondly on her face!                                           
  But when I told the cruel scorn
  That crazed that bold and lovely Knight,
  And that he crossed the mountain-woods,
    Nor rested day nor night;
  That sometimes from the savage den,                                 
  And sometimes from the darksome shade,
  And sometimes starting up at once
    In green and sunny glade,--
  There came and looked him in the face
  An angel beautiful and bright;                                      
  And that he knew it was a Fiend,
    This miserable Knight!
  And that unknowing what he did,
  He leaped amid a murderous band,
  And saved from outrage worse than death                             
    The Lady of the Land!
  And how she wept, and clasped his knees;
  And how she tended him in vain--
  And ever strove to expiate
    The scorn that crazed his brain;--                                
  And that she nursed him in a cave;
  And how his madness went away,
  When on the yellow forest-leaves
    A dying man he lay;--
  His dying words--but when I reached                                 
  That tenderest strain of all the ditty,
  My faltering voice and pausing harp
    Disturbed her soul with pity!
  All impulses of soul and sense
  Had thrilled my guileless Genevieve;                                
  The music and the doleful tale,
    The rich and balmy eve;
  And hopes, and fears that kindle hope,
  An undistinguishable throng,
  And gentle wishes long subdued,                                     
    Subdued and cherished long!
  She wept with pity and delight,
  She blushed with love, and virgin-shame;
  And like the murmur of a dream,
    I heard her breathe my name.                                      
  Her bosom heaved--she stepped aside,
  As conscious of my look she stepped--
  Then suddenly, with timorous eye
    She fled to me and wept.
  She half enclosed me with her arms,                                 
  She pressed me with a meek embrace;
  And bending back her head, looked up,
    And gazed upon my face.
  'Twas partly love, and partly fear,
  And partly 'twas a bashful art,                                     
  That I might rather feel, than see,
    The swelling of her heart.
  I calmed her fears, and she was calm,
  And told her love with virgin pride;
  And so I won my Genevieve,                                          
    My bright and beauteous Bride.
  Ye Clouds! that far above me float and pause,
    Whose pathless march no mortal may control!
    Ye Ocean-Waves! that, wheresoe'er ye roll,
  Yield homage only to eternal laws!
  Ye Woods! that listen to the night-birds' singing,                   
    Midway the smooth and perilous slope reclined,
  Save when your own imperious branches swinging,
    Have made a solemn music of the wind!
  Where, like a man beloved of God,
  Through glooms, which never woodman trod,                           
      How oft, pursuing fancies holy,
  My moonlight way o'er flowering weeds I wound,
      Inspired, beyond the guess of folly,
  By each rude shape and wild unconquerable sound!
  O ye loud Waves! and O ye Forests high!                             
    And O ye Clouds that far above me soared!
  Thou rising Sun! thou blue rejoicing Sky!
    Yea, every thing that is and will be free!
    Bear witness for me, wheresoe'er ye be,
    With what deep worship I have still adored                        
    The spirit of divinest Liberty.
  When France in wrath her giant-limbs upreared,
    And with that oath, which smote air, earth, and sea,
    Stamped her strong foot and said she would be free,
  Bear witness for me, how I hoped and feared!                        
  With what a joy my lofty gratulation
    Unawed I sang, amid a slavish band:
  And when to whelm the disenchanted nation,
    Like fiends embattled by a wizard's wand,
  The Monarchs marched in evil day,                                   
  And Britain joined the dire array;
    Though dear her shores and circling ocean,
  Though many friendships, many youthful loves
    Had swoln the patriot emotion
  And flung a magic light o'er all her hills and groves;              
  Yet still my voice, unaltered, sang defeat
    To all that braved the tyrant-quelling lance,
  And shame too long delayed and vain retreat!
  For ne'er, O Liberty! with partial aim
  I dimmed thy light or damped thy holy flame;                        
    But blessed the paeans of delivered France,
  And hung my head and wept at Britain's name.
  "And what," I said, "though Blasphemy's loud scream
    With that sweet music of deliverance strove!
    Though all the fierce and drunken passions wove                   
  A dance more wild than e'er was maniac's dream!
    Ye storms, that round the dawning east assembled,
  The Sun was rising, though ye hid his light!"
    And when, to soothe my soul, that hoped and trembled,
  The dissonance ceased, and all seemed calm and bright;              
    When France her front deep-scarred and gory
    Concealed with clustering wreaths of glory;
      When, insupportably advancing,
    Her arm made mockery of the warrior's ramp;
      While timid looks of fury glancing,                             
    Domestic treason, crushed beneath her fatal stamp,
  Writhed like a wounded dragon in his gore;
    Then I reproached my fears that would not flee;
  "And soon," I said, "shall Wisdom teach her lore
  In the low huts of them that toil and groan!                        
  And, conquering by her happiness alone,
    Shall France compel the nations to be free,
  Till Love and Joy look round, and call the Earth their own."
  Forgive me, Freedom! O forgive those dreams!
    I hear thy voice, I hear thy loud lament,                         
    From bleak Helvetia's icy caverns sent--
  I hear thy groans upon her blood-stained streams!
    Heroes, that for your peaceful country perished,
  And ye that, fleeing, spot your mountain-snows
    With bleeding wounds; forgive me, that I cherished                
  One thought that ever blessed your cruel foes!
    To scatter rage and traitorous guilt
    Where Peace her jealous home had built;
      A patriot-race to disinherit
  Of all that made their stormy wilds so dear;                        
      And with inexpiable spirit
  To taint the bloodless freedom of the mountaineer--
  O France, that mockest Heaven, adulterous, blind,
    And patriot only in pernicious toils!
  Are these thy boasts, Champion of human kind?                       
    To mix with Kings in the low lust of sway,
  Tell in the hunt, and share the murderous prey;
  To insult the shrine of Liberty with spoils
  From freemen torn; to tempt and to betray?
      The Sensual and the Dark rebel in vain,                         
    Slaves by their own compulsion! In mad game
    They burst their manacles and wear the name
      Of Freedom, graven on a heavier chain!
    O Liberty! with profitless endeavour
  Have I pursued thee, many a weary hour;                             
    But thou nor swell'st the victor's strain, nor ever
  Didst breathe thy soul in forms of human power.
    Alike from all, howe'er they praise thee,
    (Nor prayer, nor boastful name delays thee)
      Alike from Priestcraft's harpy minions,                         
    And factious Blasphemy's obscener slaves,
      Thou speedest on thy subtle pinions,
  The guide of homeless winds, and playmate of the waves!
  And there I felt thee!--on that sea-cliff's verge,
    Whose pines, scarce travelled by the breeze above,               
  Had made one murmur with the distant surge!
  Yes, while I stood and gazed, my temples bare,
  And shot my being through earth, sea and air,
    Possessing all things with intensest love,
      O Liberty! my spirit felt thee there.                          
  Late, late yestreen I saw the new Moon,
  With the old Moon in her arms;
  And I fear, I fear, my Master dear!
  We shall have a deadly storm.
  Well! If the Bard was weather-wise, who made
    The grand old ballad of Sir Patrick Spence,
    This night, so tranquil now, will not go hence
  Unroused by winds, that ply a busier trade
  Than those which mould yon cloud in lazy flakes,                     
  Or the dull sobbing draft, that moans and rakes
      Upon the strings of this Aeolian lute,
      Which better far were mute.
    For lo! the New-moon winter-bright!
    And overspread with phantom light,                                
    (With swimming phantom light o'erspread
    But rimmed and circled by a silver thread)
  I see the old Moon in her lap, foretelling
    The coming-on of rain and squally blast.
  And oh! that even now the gust were swelling,                       
    And the slant night-shower driving loud and fast!
  Those sounds which oft have raised me, whilst they awed,
      And sent my soul abroad,
  Might now perhaps their wonted impulse give,
  Might startle this dull pain, and make it move so and live!         
  A grief without a pang, void, dark, and drear,
    A stifled, drowsy, unimpassioned grief,
    Which finds no natural outlet, no relief,
        In word, or sigh, or tear--
  O Lady! in this wan and heartless mood,                             
  To other thoughts by yonder throstle wooed,
    All this long eve, so balmy and serene,
  Have I been gazing on the western sky,
    And its peculiar tint of yellow green:
  And still I gaze--and with how blank an eye!                        
  And those thin clouds above, in flakes and bars,
  That give away their motion to the stars;
  Those stars, that glide behind them or between,
  Now sparkling, now bedimmed, but always seen:
  Yon crescent Moon, as fixed as if it grew                           
  In its own cloudless, starless lake of blue;
  I see them all so excellently fair,
  I see, not feel, how beautiful they are!
      My genial spirits fail;
      And what can these avail                                        
  To lift the smothering weight from off my breast?
      It were a vain endeavour,
      Though I should gaze for ever
  On that green light that lingers in the west:
  I may not hope from outward forms to win                            
  The passion and the life, whose fountains are within.
  O Lady! we receive but what we give,
  And in our life alone does Nature live:
  Ours is her wedding garment, ours her shroud!
    And would we aught behold, of higher worth.                       
  Than that inanimate cold world allowed
  To the poor loveless ever-anxious crowd,
    Ah, from the soul itself must issue forth
  A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud
      Enveloping the Earth--                                          
  And from the soul itself must there be sent
    A sweet and potent voice, of its own birth,
  Of all sweet sounds the life and element!
  O pure of heart! thou need'st not ask of me
  What this strong music in the soul may be!                          
  What, and wherein it doth exist,
  This light, this glory, this fair luminous mist,
  This beautiful and beauty-making power.
    Joy, virtuous Lady! Joy that ne'er was given,
  Save to the pure, and in their purest hour,                         
  Life, and Life's effluence, cloud at once and shower,
  Joy, Lady! is the spirit and the power,
  Which wedding Nature to us gives in dower,
    A new Earth and new Heaven,
  Undreamt of by the sensual and the proud--                          
  Joy is the sweet voice, Joy the luminous cloud--
      We in ourselves rejoice!
  And thence flows all that charms or ear or sight,
    All melodies the echoes of that voice,
  All colours a suffusion from that light.                            
  There was a time when, though my path was rough,
    This joy within me dallied with distress,
  And all misfortunes were but as the stuff
    Whence Fancy made me dreams of happiness:
  For hope grew round me, like the twining vine,                      
  And fruits, and foliage, not my own, seemed mine.
  But now afflictions bow me down to earth:
  Nor care I that they rob me of my mirth;
      But oh! each visitation
  Suspends what nature gave me at my birth,                           
    My shaping spirit of Imagination.
  For not to think of what I needs must feel,
    But to be still and patient, all I can;
  And haply by abstruse research to steal
    From my own nature all the natural man--                          
    This was my sole resource, my only plan:
  Till that which suits a part infects the whole,
  And now is almost grown the habit of my soul.
  Hence, viper thoughts, that coil around my mind,
      Reality's dark dream!                                           
  I turn from you, and listen to the wind,
    Which long has raved unnoticed. What a scream
  Of agony by torture lengthened out
  That lute sent forth! Thou Wind, that rav'st without,
    Bare crag, or mountain-tairn, or blasted tree,                   
  Or pine-grove whither woodman never clomb,
  Or lonely house, long held the witches' home,
    Methinks were fitter instruments for thee,
  Mad Lutanist! who in this month of showers,
  Of dark-brown gardens, and of peeping flowers,                     
  Mak'st Devils' yule, with worse than wintry song,
  The blossoms, buds, and timorous leaves among.
    Thou Actor, perfect in all tragic sounds!
  Thou mighty Poet, even to frenzy bold!
      What tell'st thou now about?                                   
      'Tis of the rushing of an host in rout,
    With groans of trampled men, with smarting wounds--
  At once they groan with pain, and shudder with the cold!
  But hush! there is a pause of deepest silence!
    And all that noise, as of a rushing crowd,                       
  With groans, and tremulous shudderings--all is over--
    It tells another tale, with sounds less deep and loud!
      A tale of less affright,
      And tempered with delight,
  As Otway's self had framed the tender lay,                         
      'Tis of a little child
      Upon a lonesome wild,
  Not far from home, but she hath lost her way:
  And now moans low in bitter grief and fear,
  And now screams loud, and hopes to make her mother hear.           
  'Tis midnight, but small thoughts have I of sleep:
  Full seldom may my friend such vigils keep!
  Visit her, gentle Sleep! with wings of healing,
    And may this storm be but a mountain-birth,
  May all the stars hang bright above her dwelling,                  
    Silent as though they watched the sleeping Earth!
      With light heart may she rise,
      Gay fancy, cheerful eyes,
    Joy lift her spirit, joy attune her voice;
  To her may all things live, from pole to pole,                     
  Their life the eddying of her living soul!
    O simple spirit, guided from above,
  Dear Lady! friend devoutest of my choice,
  Thus mayest thou ever, evermore rejoice.
  Verse, a breeze mid blossoms straying,
  Where Hope clung feeding, like a bee--
  Both were mine! Life went a-maying
    With Nature, Hope, and Poesy,
      When I was young!                                                
  _When_ I was young?--Ah, woful When!
  Ah! for the change 'twixt Now and Then!
  This breathing house not built with hands,
  This body that does me grievous wrong,
  O'er aery cliffs and glittering sands,                              
  How lightly _then_ it flashed along:--
  Like those trim skiffs, unknown of yore,
  On winding lakes and rivers wide,
  That ask no aid of sail or oar,
  That fear no spite of wind or tide!                                 
  Nought cared this body for wind or weather
  When Youth and I lived in 't together.
  Flowers are lovely; Love is flower-like;
  Friendship is a sheltering tree;
  O! the joys, that came down shower-like,                            
  Of Friendship, Love, and Liberty,
    Ere I was old!
  _Ere_ I was old? Ah woful Ere,
  Which tells me Youth 's no longer here!
  O Youth! for years so many and sweet,                               
  'Tis known, that thou and I were one,
  I'll think it but a fond conceit--
  It cannot be that thou art gone!
  Thy vesper-bell hath not yet tolled:--
  And thou wert aye a masker bold!                                    
  What strange disguise hast now put on,
  To _make believe_, that thou art gone?
  I see these locks in silvery slips,
  This drooping gait, this altered size:
  But Spring-tide blossoms on thy lips,                               
  And tears take sunshine from thine eyes!
  Life is but thought: so think I will
  That Youth and I are house-mates still.
  Dew-drops are the gems of morning,
  But the tears of mournful eve!                                      
  Where no hope is, life 's a warning
  That only serves to make us grieve,
    When we are old:
  That only serves to make us grieve
  With oft and tedious taking-leave,                                  
  Like some poor nigh-related guest,
  That may not rudely be dismist;
  Yet hath outstayed his welcome while,
  And tells the jest without the smile.
  All Nature seems at work. Slugs leave their lair--
  The bees are stirring--birds are on the wing--
  And Winter slumbering in the open air,
  Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring!
  And I the while, the sole unbusy thing,                              
  Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.
  Yet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow,
  Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow.
  Bloom, O ye amaranths! bloom for whom ye may,
  For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away!                     
  With lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll:
  And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul?
  Work without Hope draws nectar in a sieve,
  And Hope without an object cannot live.
  Stop, Christian passer-by!--Stop, child of God,
  And read with gentle breast. Beneath this sod
  A poet lies, or that which once seemed he.--
  O, lift one thought in prayer for S.T.C.;
  That he who many a year with toil of breath                          
  Found death in life, may here find life in death!
  Mercy for praise--to be forgiven for fame
  He ask'd, and hoped, through Christ.
    Do thou the same!
